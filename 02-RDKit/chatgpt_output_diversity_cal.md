
To calculate the Tanimoto diversity for a compound library, you'll need to use chemical fingerprints or binary representations of the compounds. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Create the binary fingerprints for each compound in the library. Chemical fingerprints are binary representations that indicate the presence or absence of specific chemical features or substructures.

Step 2: Calculate the Tanimoto similarity coefficient between each pair of compounds in the library using the formula:

\[ \text{Tanimoto Similarity} = \frac{A \cap B}{A \cup B} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the fingerprint of compound A.
- \( B \) is the fingerprint of compound B.
- \( A \cap B \) represents the number of common bits (1s) in the fingerprints of compounds A and B.
- \( A \cup B \) represents the total number of bits that are either 1 in the fingerprint of A or B (including common bits).

Step 3: Calculate the Tanimoto diversity for the library, which is typically expressed as the average similarity across all compound pairs. You can use the formula:

\[ \text{Tanimoto Diversity} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \text{Tanimoto Similarity}_{ij}}{N} \]

Where:
- \( n \) is the total number of compounds in the library.
- \( \text{Tanimoto Similarity}_{ij} \) is the Tanimoto similarity coefficient between compound \( i \) and compound \( j \).
- \( N \) is the total number of unique compound pairs ( \( N = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) for \( n \) compounds).

Here's a simplified example using a small compound library with 3 compounds:

Suppose you have the following binary fingerprints for the compounds:

Compound A: 11010100
Compound B: 10010001
Compound C: 01100010

Step 2: Calculate the Tanimoto similarity between all pairs:

Tanimoto(A, B) = \(\frac{3}{8}\)
Tanimoto(A, C) = \(\frac{2}{7}\)
Tanimoto(B, C) = \(\frac{1}{7}\)

Step 3: Calculate the Tanimoto diversity for the library:

Tanimoto Diversity = \(\frac{\frac{3}{8} + \frac{2}{7} + \frac{1}{7}}{3} \approx 0.345\)

The Tanimoto diversity for this compound library is approximately 0.345, which indicates the average dissimilarity or diversity between the compounds based on their chemical fingerprints.
